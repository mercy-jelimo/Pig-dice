# Pig-dice
This website is about a game 'pig-dice' that has three variations; Two dice pig, skunk and big pig, they all have two classes easy and hard. 

## Getting started
*Two-Dice Pig*
This variation is the same as Pig, except:
Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game)
*Big Pig*
This variation is the same as Two-Dice Pig, except:
If two 1s are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total.
If other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total.
*Skunk*
Skunk (or Think) is a variation of Two-Dice Pig that is played with large groups. Rather than rolling in turn, all players begin the round standing. At any point in the round, a player may hold by sitting down. The round continues until a 1 is rolled, or all players have sat down. Skunk is played in five rounds, and scoring is recorded in a 5-column table with columns labeled with the letters of the word "SKUNK". The first round score is entered in the "S"-column, the next in the first "K"-column, and so on. After five rounds, the highest-scoring player is the winner.
